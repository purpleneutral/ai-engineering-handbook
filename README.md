# AI Notes (Living Guide)

This repo is a practical, GitHub-friendly reference for modern AI/LLM engineering.

**Scope**
- Core LLM concepts: how models behave, common failure modes, and how to design around them
- Patterns: prompting, RAG, agents, evals, safety, and ops
- Focus: ideas and checklists that stay useful even as specific models change

**Keeping it current**
- Date-stamp fast-changing claims with an explicit `As of YYYY-MM-DD, ...`
- Prefer primary sources (vendor docs, papers, specs) over screenshots and secondary summaries
- Treat model pricing, limits, and policy details as volatile unless you re-check them
