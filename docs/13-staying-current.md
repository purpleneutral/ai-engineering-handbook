# Staying Current (Without Chasing Hype)

Last reviewed: 2026-02-10

## Summary
Most "current AI" content is either marketing or too shallow to operationalize. Use a small set of high-signal sources, and treat vendor docs as the source of truth for capabilities and limits.

## What To Track
- New capabilities that change architectures (tool calling, structured outputs, long-context behavior, multimodal IO).
- Reliability and safety changes (policy updates, sandboxing/tool constraints, data handling).
- Pricing/limits and latency changes (volatile; always date-stamp).

## A Practical Intake Loop
1. Add a link to `docs/10-reading-list.md` if it is evergreen.
2. If it is timely, add an `As of YYYY-MM-DD` note to the relevant topic page.
3. Write 2-3 bullets: what changed, what it enables, and what it breaks (what to re-test).

## Recommended Sources
- Vendor docs and changelogs (capabilities, limits, migration guides).
- Weekly digests (to avoid doomscrolling).
- Paper feeds for deeper dives, with selective reading.
