- Agent: an LLM-driven loop that can call tools and iterate toward a goal.
- Chunking: splitting documents into units for retrieval.
- Context window: the maximum amount of input/output tokens a model can consider at once.
- Embedding: a vector representation of content used for similarity search.
- Few-shot: providing examples in the prompt to guide behavior.
- Grounding: tying outputs to external sources (often via retrieval).
- Hallucination: output that is plausible but not supported by truth or provided sources.
- Prompt injection: malicious or accidental instructions embedded in untrusted text.
- RAG: retrieval-augmented generation, combining retrieval with generation.
- Tool calling: having the model request external actions (APIs, functions) in a structured way.
